A collection of tiny Python projects. They are very simple and little and basically just tiny easy pet projects. Here's a quick summary:

hangman.py - Very similar to hangman where it makes the user guess a word letter by letter within a certain number of turns. The word(s) are randomly generated from a list of hardcoded words and this project is mostly while loop and list practice.

speed-accuracy-typer.py - Gets the user to type words as fast as possible and calculates their speed and accuracy, using the Time module to track time. This is mostly matrix and number-crunching practice.

speed-accuracy-typer-v2.py - Basically a more accurate version of the speed-accuracy-typer.py, but with more accurate results. It doesn't use the matrix as heavily and is literally only for fun.

decimal-numbers.py - Takes user input and either converts to or from binary or hexadecimal depending on which they select, using my little algorithm. Uses lists and a little math.

IEEE-32-bit-maker.py - Takes user input and converts it to IEEE 754 32-bit recision floating point format. Can only handle decimals and catches if user enters an int or "cheats" by entering an int disguised as a decimal (for example, 12.0). A lot of converting to string and float and int and back to make it work and look pretty.
