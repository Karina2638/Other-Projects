A collection of tiny Python projects. They are very simple and little and basically just tiny easy pet projects. Here's a quick summary:

hangman.py - Very similar to hangman where it makes the user guess a word letter by letter within a certain number of turns. The word(s) are randomly generated from a list of hardcoded words and this project is mostly while loop and list practice.

speed-accuracy-typer.py - Gets the user to type words as fast as possible and calculates their speed and accuracy, using the Time module to track time. This is mostly matrix and number-crunching practice.
